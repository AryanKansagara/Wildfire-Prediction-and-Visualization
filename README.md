# Wildfire Prediction and Visualization

**A Python-based project to predict wildfire spread using real-time weather and fire data, paired with geospatial visualizations to aid decision-making and risk assessment.**

## Features
- ðŸ”¥ Predict wildfire spread based on weather and location data.
- ðŸŒŽ Visualize fire locations and affected areas on an interactive map.
- ðŸš€ Easy-to-use modular design for integration and scaling.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wildfire-prediction.git
   ```
2. Set Up Virtual Environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv env  
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'  
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Fetch weather and fire data using the provided scripts:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. API keys in the .env
   Replace placeholders in fetch_fire.py and fetch_weather.py with your NASA FIRMS and OpenWeatherMap API keys.

3. View the visualization: Open visualizations/fire_map.html in your browser.
